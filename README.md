# Sales-and-Customer-Insights-Dashboard

# Overview
This project demonstrates how Power BI dashboards can be used to translate raw e-commerce transaction data into clear, decision-ready insights for sales growth, product strategy, and outlet performance.

Using Power BI, I analysed grocery retail data to uncover:

- Revenue drivers

- Product performance patterns
 
- Outlet=level sales differences

- Customer buying preferences

The dashboard is designed for business users, not analysts, enabling faster, data-backed decisions.

# Business Problem

E-commerce grocery platforms handle large volumes of transactional data but often struggle to convert it into actionable insights.

Key challenges addressed:

- Which products and categories drive the most revenue?

- How do outlet type, size, and location affect sales?

- What customer preferences influence buying decisions?

- How can sales trends guide inventory and expansion strategy?

# Solution Approach

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on business clarity and usability.

**🔹 Core Performance Metrics**

- Total Sales

- Average Sales

- Number of Items Sold

- Average Customer Rating

**🔹 Product & Customer Insights**

- Sales by item type

- Customer preference by fat content

- Category-level contribution to revenue

**🔹 Outlet & Channel Performance**

- Sales by outlet type, size, and location tier

- Performance by outlet establishment year

- Identification of high-performing outlet formats

**🔹 Trend Analysis**

- Sales trends over time

- Identification of peak and low-performance periods

# Key Business Insights & Impact

- Total sales reached ~$1.2M, with strong concentration in specific categories
 → Enables focused inventory and promotion planning

- Regular fat products contributed ~65% of total sales
 → Indicates clear customer preference and stocking priority

- Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods were top revenue drivers
 → High-impact categories for promotions and bundling strategies

- Supermarket Type-1 outlets generated the majority of sales
 → Best-performing outlet format for scaling and replication

- Tier-3 locations outperformed Tier-1 and Tier-2
 → Signals opportunity for targeted expansion and investment

# Strategic Recommendations

- Prioritize inventory and shelf visibility for high-performing categories

- Focus promotional efforts on dominant outlet types and locations

- Design outlet-specific strategies based on size and location performance

- Use sales trends to plan seasonal campaigns and stock replenishment

- Improve positioning of lower-performing product segments strategically (not uniformly)

# Tools & Technologies

- Power BI

- Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power BI / Power Query)

- Interactive Dashboards & KPI Reporting

# Why this Matters for Your Business

This project shows how dashboards can:

- Reduce decision-making time

- Improve visibility across sales channels

- Support inventory and expansion decisions

- Align teams around a single source of truth

The same dashboard framework can be applied to:

- E-commerce platforms

- Grocery and FMCG businesses

- Multi-outlet retail chains

# 📌 Note

This analysis uses a publicly available grocery retail dataset (Blinkit-style) for demonstration purposes.

The insights and dashboard structure are directly applicable to real business data.
